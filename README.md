# String Art Generator

This project provides a simple UI for generating string art from images. Upload an image, set your desired parameters, and generate a string art simulation. The app displays a canvas preview of the resulting string art and provides a downloadable file with step-by-step instructions for recreating the design in real life.

## Features

- **Image Upload:** Select an image to use as the basis for your string art.
